/// A Snag is a boilerplate-free error type that can be used to track why an
/// error happened, though does not store as much detail on specific errors as a
/// custom error type would.

/// want good debugging information to print to the user. i.e. Command line
/// tools, data processing pipelines, etc.
///
/// If it not suited to code where the application needs to make a decision about
/// what to do in the event of an error, such as whether to give up or to try
/// again. i.e. Libraries, web application backends, API clients, etc.
/// In these situations it is recommended to create a custom type for your errors
/// as it can be pattern matched on and have any additional detail added as
